# ALIEXPRESS

**Description:**  
This project is an e-commerce frontend interface inspired by ALIEXPRESS. It enables users to browse products, manage carts, and securely authenticate using Firebase. Users can browse products without the need for login/signup, but will be redirected to the authentication page when attempting to add items to the cart or visit cart page. The project features efficient state management using Redux Toolkit and a fully responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.

## Setup and Access Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine
- **npm** for managing dependencies
- **Firebase** account for authentication
- API from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)

### Steps to Access the App:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yanil8068/aliExpress.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd aliExpress
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```bash
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTHDOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECTID=your-firebase-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGEBUCKET=your-firebase-storagebucket
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDERID=your-firebase-messaging-senderid
   VITE_FIREBASE_APPID=your-firebase-appid
   VITE_API_BASE_URI=https://fakestoreapi.com
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

6. **Deployment**:
   You can deploy the app on platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Development Process

### Planning & Design

- The project started with designing a modern UI inspired by aliExpress, using React for a component-based architecture.
- Tailwind CSS was chosen for responsive, customizable components.
- Redux Toolkit was used to manage global states, like cart data and user authentication.

### Authentication Setup

- Integrated Firebase for secure user authentication.
- Implemented login and signup, with an automatic redirect to the login page when users attempt cart actions without being logged in.

### Cart & Product Management

- Users can browse products and manage the cart with add/remove functionality.
- Redux Toolkit ensures that the cart state is persistent across pages and sessions.

### Search Functionality

- A search component allows users to filter products in real-time as they type.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions

- **User Authentication Persistence Across Tabs**:  
  _Problem_: Users were logged out when switching between tabs.  
  _Solution_: Firebase session persistence was leveraged alongside the `onAuthStateChanged` function, which observes and maintains the authentication state across pages.

- **Maintaining a Responsive UI**:  
  _Problem_: Ensuring the UI remained consistent across various screen sizes.  
  _Solution_: Tailwind CSS was used to provide a utility-first, responsive design that adapts well to different devices.

- **Authentication Redirects**:  
  _Problem_: Users faced infinite redirects when adding items to the cart without authentication.  
  _Solution_: The issue was resolved by ensuring that the user state was only updated during login/signup and correctly managing session data with Redux.

## Key Learnings

This project provided valuable insights into full-stack development, particularly in:

- Managing complex state with Redux Toolkit
- Integrating Firebase for secure authentication
- Handling authentication persistence and UI responsiveness
